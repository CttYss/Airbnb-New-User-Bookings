    "#### OVERVIEW\n",
    "The problem this capstone project aims at solving is predicting where a newly registered Airbnb user will book his/her first travel experience. By analyzing a variety of data such as user informations, country information and user browsing session records, the project aims at coming up with a model that could accurately detect where a user would book his/her first experience from an array of 34000+ cities across 190+ countries.\n",
    "#### THE CLIENT\n",
    "The Client in question is Airbnb, an online marketplace and hospitality service enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostels beds, or hotel rooms, Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has expanded into more than 190 countries and 34,000 cities across the planet. It has disrupted the hotel industry and has become the premier choice of booking for many travelers across the globe with people booking a wide variety of spaces from tree houses to houseboats to apartments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user first signs up for Airbnb, it is in the user’s and Airbnb’s best interests to show homes and places in a city and country that the user intends on visiting. Since it is not possible to explicitly ask the user for this data and expect the user to update his/her preference (a user may just be browsing, s/he may change preference from time to time and may not update that in his/her profile, etc.), it would make sense to actually build a predictive model around the user’s browsing data and give predictions based on it."

    "#### THE DATA\n",
    "The data is already available to us in the form of a Kaggle competition hosted by Airbnb in 2015. Therefore, there isn’t a need for additional data mining or web scraping. The data will however have to be cleaned and wrangled before any analysis is performed on it.\n",

    "The data provided by Airbnb is in the form of CSV files and are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. train_users.csv​: The training set of users\n",

    "#### DATA WRANGLING\n",
    "##### Overview\n",
    "This section describes the various data cleaning and data wrangling methods applied on the\n",
    "Airbnb datasets to make it more suitable for further analysis. The following sections are divided based on the datasets provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Age,​ ​Gender​ ​and​ ​Statistics\n",
    "1. The age bucket was converted into a mean age feature. This was done to treat age as a\n",
    "numerical feature. Furthermore, the numerical nature of the data will make it easier to\n",
    "perform one hot encoding and label encoding on this feature later.\n",
    "2. The year feature was dropped as it had only one value, 2015. Therefore, it was giving us\n",
    "no extra information and could be safely dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Countries\n",
    "The dataset is clean and extremely small. No wrangling or cleaning techniques were used on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sessions\n",
    "1. All the unknown fields were converted into NaN to give it more semantic meaning.\n",
    "2. The missing second values were interpolated using the Pandas Series Interpolate\n",
    "function. This was done as this treatment did not significantly alter the summary statistics\n",
    "of seconds elapsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Training Users\n",
    "1. All unknown values were converted into NaN to give it more semantic meaning.\n",
    "2. Samples for which age was greater than 120 was converted into NaN as these clearly\n",
    "represented polluted data."
